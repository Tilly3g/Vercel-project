# Question 6

## A customer writes in to the Helpdesk stating "I have a custom domain which I purchased at GoDaddy and I want to use it on my project". In a couple of paragraphs, how do you respond?

Hi There,

You can absolutely use your custom domain with your Vercel project. To do this you'll need to follow the below steps:

Go to your project in Vercel > Click on the Settings tab > Go to 'Domains' > Enter the domain you want to add

Once you've done this, you'll need to configure the domain differently depending on whether or not it is an Apex domain or subdomain. For Apex domains you can either use an `A` record or the Nameservers method, and for subdomains it would be a `CNAME` record or the Nameservers method.

For more information on the above steps and configuring the domain, please see our documentation [here](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/custom-domains#). This will go in to more detail on the steps provided, including screenshots, to help you through the process.

Please give this a go and let me know how you get on or if you need any more help with this?

Best Regards

Tilly
