# Question 7

## What do you think is one of the most common problems which customers ask Vercel for help with? How would you help customers to overcome common problems, short-term and long-term?



To help customers overcome common problems in the short term, I would answer their questions and direct them on how to resolve the issue they are having. To solve these problems in the long term, I would take a look at the public documentation and if it doesn't exist for the problem then I would create a document. If it does exist, I would also link the customer to it so they know where to find it in future and check to make sure it's easy to find and the title is intuitive to come up in searches. Depending on what the problem is, it may also be worth discussing it with the product team, and coming up with solutions in the product that would resolve the issue for good. I'd love to be a part of implementing the solutions we come up with as well!
