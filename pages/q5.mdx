# Question 5

## A customer writes in to the Helpdesk asking "How do I do a redirect from /hello-vercel to https://vercel.com?" In a couple of paragraphs, how do you respond?

Hi,

Thanks for getting in touch with us! You can do this easily by making use of the `next.config.js` file if you're using next.js, or the `vercel.json` file in all other cases. Please take a look at our documentation on this [here](https://vercel.com/support/articles/does-vercel-support-permanent-redirects?query=redire#in-application-redirects), an example of each case is below.

In the `next.config.js` file use:
```
module.exports = {
  async redirects() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/hello-vercel',
        destination: 'https://vercel.com',
        permanent: true,
      },
    ]
  },
}
```

In the `vercel.json` file use:
```
{
  "redirects": [
    { 
      "source": "/hello-vercel",
      "destination": "https://vercel.com", 
      "permanent": true
    }
  ]
}
```
Please give this a go and let me know how you get on.

Best Regards,

Tilly
