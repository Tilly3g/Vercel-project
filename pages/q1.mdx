# Question 1

## From [this list](https://gist.github.com/Pieparker/b04a4e9ff82ba949e5db9d5b0e9d89e8), rank your 5 most favourite and 5 least favourite tasks. Please provide reasons why each task is your most or least favourite.

### Favourite Tasks:

- Identify, file (and, where possible, resolve) bugs in private and public Vercel/Next.js repos on GitHub

I love the sound of this; digging through code to find bugs and, when I can, resolving them is one of the main reasons I transitioned in to technical support.
I love the feeling of accomplishment when I finally find what's wrong.

- Dig through logs to troubleshoot a customer's broken project

Again this is the same reasoning as above, helping customers resolve their problems by my own investigation, or collaboratively with my colleagues if needed, is a great feeling.

- Help train and onboard new support teammates

I'm a people person so working closely with new teammates is something I really enjoy. I also find that not only does it help them, but it can be invaluable to me as well, for example if we take on a ticket together that I've not come accross either. It's such an important thing to not only be able to do something to the highest standard yourself, but to help mentor and train others to do the same thing, enabling them to succeed and perform to the best of their ability!

- Write and maintain support articles and docs pages

Anything that will help improve a customers experience and find and resolve a, either by making it easier for them to find and resolve a problem on their own or letting them know what we need from them in order to help them as fast as possible. This is something I do a lot as part of my current role, noticing trends from support tickets and writing documentation accordingly.

- Work with the product team to develop a new feature based on feedback from customers

Customers have really valuable input, and it would be so great to be a part of making their ideas reality.

### Least Favourite Tasks:

- Work with 3rd party partners to track down a tricky situation for a joint customer

I know this is sometimes necessary and I would never decline these tasks, but it can be difficult to get answers quickly and these situations can prolong resolving a customers issue, I like to try to get their problems resolved as quickly as possible with the best outcome. 

- Manage a support team

This is super important and I'm more then happy to help out when needed, however, my passion lies in the troubleshooting and bugfixing, which is why this has made it on to this list. I want to emphasize that this doesn't include mentoring junior team members, I love this and think it's so valuable to pass on knowledge; not only tell others the answer, but help them so that they can use these skills themselves and even continue to pass the knowledge on to others.

- Respond to 50+ support requests via email every day

I always strive to tackle as many requests as possible, but I know that these tickets can be more technical than your average IT support and if a ticket is more tricky I would rather take that extra time for the best outcome for the customer.

- Engage multiple users at once in a public discussion, to answer their questions and troubleshoot problems

Whilst I would happily join a task like this to answer questions and solve more simple issues, I do prefer tackling trickier problems as opart of a ticket. That way I can give it my full attention and be able to come to a resolution faster.

- Help resolve billing issues for customers

These issues are always going to come up and whilst I have no problem jumping on them and helping customers out with these, I do find the trickier problems more fun in terms of the investigation needed and the wider range of tickets these involve.
