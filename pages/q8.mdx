# Question 8

## How could we improve or alter this familiarisation exercise?

I really enjoyed this exercise, using vercel and also getting to know next.js. I think it would be good if the excercise required further use of Vercel, for example there could be some deployment steps that need to be followed making use of branches, Pull Request checks and the Vercel bot previews and deployment. A dummy project could also be privided that may need certain build settings and environment variables to be manually configured in Vercel in order for the deployment to be successful as well!
