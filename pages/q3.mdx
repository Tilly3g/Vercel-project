# Question 3

## Which technical article, guide or lightning talk left the biggest positive impression on you? Why? Ideally, this article would not be associated with Vercel or web development, by the way! Please provide links.

This is a hard question as there are so many that have helped me since I decided to start the complete career u-turn in different ways! I think [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfBWk4nw440) talk, You Should Learn to Program by Christian Genco, is one of my favourites. I watched it a few years ago for the first time when I was thinking about turning to coding and it really helped to solidify the decision. I was struggling with the thought of starting something completely new but the way that Christian talks about coding, the things it can do, and how he urges everyone to learn, with no mention of making the decision early in life really helped me get the confidence to make the change. He also talks about how easy it is to do which again helped and turned out to be true as well!

I think this is a really great talk because it's also very fun, it makes me laugh and is gripping. I think the way he talks about coding is very clever, the message I think would appeal to everyone, learn to code and you can then create infinite tools to make your life easier! He makes coding sound so exciting and magical, but at the same time acheivable.
